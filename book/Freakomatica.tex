% Place Value and Operations: Introduce the concept of place value, where the position of a digit determines its value within a number. Teach addition and subtraction with regrouping (carrying and borrowing) to develop a deeper understanding of arithmetic operations.

\chapter{Addition and Subtraction}%!chapter
% the numbers
% being added are called the addends, and the result the sum
% Carrying is performed when the sum of a column of addends is more than 9. Addition is
% commutative, meaning a + b = b + a
% associative, meaning (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).
% Adding zero to a number results in that same number, making zero the
% additive identity, e.g., a + 0 = a. Subtraction is the inverse of addition. In
% subtraction, for example in a − b, a is the minuend and b the subtrahend. In
% contrast to addition, subtraction is neither commutative nor associative. Just
% as carrying is often required when adding a column of numbers, borrowing is
% often required when subtracting numbers. The symbol ±, read ‘plus or minus’,
% can be used to denote an uncertainty or a pair of values (e.g., the two roots of
% the quadratic equation).

\chapter{Multiplication and division}%!chapter
% Introduction to multiplication and division
% Multiplication tables and strategies
% Division facts and strategies
% Word problems involving multiplication and division


% Multiplication and division were extremely challenging using early
% numeral systems that did not employ positional notation, such as Egyptian,
% Greek, and Roman numerals. The numeral and arithmetic system eventually
% adopted in Europe was developed in India, with important advances made in
% the sixth and seventh centuries. In the multiplication a × b = c, a is the
% multiplier, b the multiplicand and c the product; a and b are also called
% factors. Notation for multiplication of two numbers a and b includes a × b, a ·
% b, (a)(b) and, favoured by mathematicians, simply ab. Similar to addition,
% carrying is necessary when the product of a column of digits is more than 9.
% In the example a × 1 = a, 1 is the multiplicative identity. Multiplication is
% commutative, meaning a × b = b × a, and associative, meaning (a × b) × c = a ×
% (b × c). Division is neither. In the division a ÷ b = c, a is the dividend, b the
% divisor, and c the quotient. Mathematicians favour the notation a/b to a ÷ b.
% Long division is a division algorithm that displays the dividend (the amount to
% divide), divisor (number you divide by), and quotient (the answer) in a tableau.
% For mathematicians, division of any number by zero is undefined because it
% doesn’t make sense in a rigorous manner.


% Multiplication is repeated addition of a first number a specified second
% number of times. Division is determining how many times one quantity is
% contained in another
